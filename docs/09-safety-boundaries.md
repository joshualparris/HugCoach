# Safety + Boundaries Policy


## Core Principles


### 1. Consent is Paramount
- All content emphasizes **mutual, enthusiastic, ongoing consent**
- No activities should ever be pressured or coerced
- Either partner can pause/stop at any time
- "No" is always respected without guilt


### 2. Privacy First
- All data stored locally (SQLite)
- No telemetry or usage tracking
- No cloud sync without explicit opt-in
- User can export/delete all data anytime


### 3. Non-Coercive Education
- App teaches skills, never dictates outcomes
- No "you must do X" language
- Frames intimacy as collaborative exploration
- Acknowledges individual differences (not one-size-fits-all)


### 4. Age-Appropriate
- Designed for married adults (18+)
- No content involving minors under any circumstance


### 5. Medical Disclaimers
- App is NOT medical advice
- Does not diagnose, treat, or cure conditions
- Recommends professional help when needed


## Content Guardrails


### Prohibited Content
 **Never Include**:
- Explicit sexual imagery or pornographic material
- Coercive or manipulative tactics
- Content that could be used to pressure a partner
- Medical diagnoses or treatment plans
- Advice that violates consent principles
- Content involving non-consenting individuals
- Anything promoting harm or abuse


### Permitted Content
 **Allowed**:
- Evidence-based relationship education
- Communication frameworks (Gottman, Johnson, etc.)
- Anatomy/physiology education (clinical terminology)
- Consent negotiation strategies
- Mindfulness and presence techniques
- Christian theology on marriage (respectful framing)
- Research summaries (porn effects, attachment theory)


### Gray Areas (Handle with Care)
 **Requires Careful Framing**:
- **Intimacy techniques**: Frame as "options to explore together," not prescriptions
- **Desire discrepancy**: Validate both partners, emphasize communication
- **Porn impact**: Present research without shame, focus on recovery
- **Religious content**: Respect diverse interpretations, avoid dogmatism


## Safety Warnings


### When to Display Warnings


#### Conflict Warning
**Trigger**: Content on desire discrepancy, conflict resolution
**Message**: 
> "If discussing this topic creates conflict in your relationship, consider pausing and seeking support from a licensed therapist or counselor. This app is for education, not crisis intervention."


#### Medical Referral
**Trigger**: Content on pain, dysfunction, persistent issues
**Message**:
> "If you experience pain, persistent difficulties, or concerning symptoms, please consult a healthcare provider. This app does not replace medical advice."


#### Mental Health Referral
**Trigger**: Content on porn addiction, shame, depression
**Message**:
> "If you're struggling with compulsive behaviors, shame, or low mood, please reach out to a mental health professional. Resources: [link to SAMHSA, BetterHelp, etc.]"


#### Consent Reminder
**Trigger**: Content on trying new activities
**Message**:
> "Remember: Both partners must enthusiastically consent to any activity. It's always okay to say 'not right now' or 'let's talk about this first.'"
